Now say you receive a job offer from a great company on the other side of the city with great career prospects. However given the far distance from your current place you unfortunately must move if you decide to accept the offer. Wouldn't it be great if you're able to determine neighborhoods on the other side of the city that are exactly the same as your current neighborhood, and if not perhaps similar neighborhoods that are at least closer to your new job?"

In the plot of WSS-versus-k, this is visible as an **elbow.**\n\n\nWithin-Cluster-Sum of Squared Errors sounds a bit complex. Let\u2019s break it down:\n* The Squared Error for each point is the square of the distance of the point from its representation i.e. its predicted cluster center.\n* The WSS score is the sum of these Squared Errors for all the points.\n* Any distance metric like the Euclidean Distance or the Manhattan Distance can be used."

If many points have a negative Silhouette value, it may indicate that we have created too many or too few clusters.\n\nThe Silhouette Value s(i) for each data point i is defined as follows:\n\n![alt text](https://miro.medium.com/max/295/1*vFXfyIjIjI_kbZNWODiuxQ.jpeg \"Calculation Formula\")\n\n* Here, a(i) is the measure of similarity of the point i to its own cluster.
